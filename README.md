# Nejime

Nejime is a tracker inspired by LSDj made for creating songs in a browser which can then be shared by saving the song and sharing the link that is created. It is in an early alpha stage and likely has bugs and missing features.

In the future I would like to add more instrument types, MIDI export and audio rendering.
